#### About this repository
Current respository is 2nd part of Web-Development which include 10 websites built by myself (khusanov-m) As respository starts weighting more than 200mb, I decided to create additional repositories each will contain 10 projects too, with almost the same title except part (P) indicators. So it will be easier to find others.
